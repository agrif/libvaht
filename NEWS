after a long time, I've got back to work. tMOV files now have an
interface that changes stco atoms in-stream so that they will
play correctly as standalone files.

tBMP support should now be complete, further changes should be just
optimization. Yay!

I changed the build system to GNU autotools, just to get out of the dark ages
and into the new century.

Oh, and also tBMP format introspection and truecolor support for that one
guy's picture. I hope he's proud of all the work he forced me through.
